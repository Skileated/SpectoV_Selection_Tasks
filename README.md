# SpectoV Selection Tasks

This repository contains solutions to multiple machine learning and data processing tasks submitted for the SpectoV recruitment process. Each task is organized in its own folder and focuses on a specific technique or concept in data science, clustering, dimensionality reduction, or image processing.

---

## 📁 Task Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Clustering (DBSCAN vs K-Means)
- **Objective:** Compare the performance of K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms on a sample dataset.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Understand the differences between density-based and centroid-based clustering.
  - Learn parameter tuning and its effect on clustering quality.
  - Visualize clusters and evaluate results.

---

### ✅ Task 2: Image Compression using K-Means
- **Objective:** Compress an image by reducing the number of colors using K-Means clustering.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Apply unsupervised learning to image data.
  - Understand how clustering can be used for data reduction.
  - Work with pixel-level color quantization.

---

### ✅ Task 3: Dimensionality Reduction (PCA & t-SNE)
- **Objective:** Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D using PCA and t-SNE.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Compare linear (PCA) and nonlinear (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques.
  - Evaluate structure-preserving projections.
  - Understand computational trade-offs and interpretability.

---

### ✅ Task 4: Human Activity Recognition (UCI HAR Dataset)
- **Objective:** Perform clustering on the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset using K-Means and DBSCAN after reducing dimensions with PCA.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Work with real-world time-series sensor data.
  - Apply dimensionality reduction before clustering.
  - Compare clustering quality on high-dimensional time-series features.

---

### ✅ Task 5: Image Segmentation using K-Means
- **Objective:** Segment an image by grouping similar pixels using K-Means clustering.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Preprocess and reshape images for unsupervised learning.
  - Interpret segmented output.
  - Understand how clustering can assist in basic computer vision tasks.

---

### ✅ Task 6: Image Segmentation Project (Submodule)
- **Objective:** Explore a larger version of Task 5 as a separate Git repository.
- **Note:** This task is included as a **Git submodule**.
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Manage Git submodules for modular project structure.
  - Scale image segmentation techniques into structured projects.
